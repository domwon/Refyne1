        <h1>REFYNE</h1>
        <h2>Chemical Engineering</h2>
        <h3>What is Chemical Engineering?</h3>
        <p>Chemical engineering associates chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics to generate models and systems through the use of chemicals. Surprisingly, chemical engineering  takes a back seat when it comes to selected majors. In high school, very little is taught on this subject, even the basic principles. Refyne strives to introduce K-12 students to this growing major and developing field. Through an interactive, strategic game, Refyne will help promote chemical engineering concepts and implant the foundation required of all chemical engineeers.</p>
        
        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>The objective of the game is to insert pipes and/or heaters to match the expected output pressure and temperature. Initially, you are given an input pressure and temperature. Your task is to find the correct combination (there is likely more than one!) of pipes and heaters to generate the expected output conditions.</p>
        <h3>How To Play</h3>
        <p>The following diagram will represent the playing field:</p>
        <!--Display 3x3 grid here-->
        <p>This grid will be where you place each of your elements, whether it be a pipe or a heater. You will start at the shaded box next to the input field and place your first move there. After that, legal moves are the surrounding boxes that are shaded around it.</p>
        <!--Display powerup container-->
        <p>Each chemical engineer is equipped with the required tools to complete their daily tasks on time. Above, you will find yours! (Pipes and heaters).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pipes: Each pipe will decrease the pressure by 1 psi or 2 psi.</li>
            <li>Heaters: Each heater is defaulted to increase the temperature by 50 C.</li>
            <ul>
                <!--Display modal for temperature adjustment-->
                <li>Bonus!: You can change the generated temperature of each heater by simply clicking on it. Drag the slider to your desired temperature and click "Submit Heat" to update the temperature for that heater.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Each move that you make will represent the path that the system will run through. Because you cannot work backwards (starting from the output field), plan carefully! However, even chemical engineers make mistakes. If you wish you replace a move, simply drag another element on top of the desired box.</p>
        <p>Did something bigger go wrong that a simple replace can't fix? Easy enough. At the top you will find a restart button. Any hefty mistakes will be taken care of by completely resetting the board.</p>
        <!--Display the restart button-->
        <p>Now go develop your skills! Chemical engineers believe in your potential and await for your talents to be applied to the real world.</p>
