    <h2 class="header">Refyne's Mission</h2>
    <p>Chemical engineering associates chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics to generate models and systems through the use of chemicals. Surprisingly, chemical engineering  takes a back seat when it comes to selected majors. In high school, very little is taught on this subject, even the basic principles. Refyne strives to introduce K-12 students to this growing major and developing field. Through an interactive, strategic game, Refyne will help promote chemical engineering concepts and implant the foundation required of all future chemical engineeers.</p>
